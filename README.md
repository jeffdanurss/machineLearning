Overview of the Code
Line 11: Begins the definition of the network architecture.
Line 12: Defines a neural network model using Keras with TensorFlow for classification, likely designed to work with 28x28 pixel images.
Line 14: Covers the compilation step of the model, where the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics are set.
Line 15: Prepares the image data for training, including any necessary preprocessing or augmentation steps.
Line 17: Involves fitting the model, where the neural network is trained on the prepared data.
Line 18: Evaluates the model on new data, providing insights into the model's performance on unseen data.
